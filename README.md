# Price Feed Script for BitShares

## Installation 

### Installation using Docker

Build docker image:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Zapata/bitshares-pricefeed.git
cd bitshares-pricefeed
docker build -t bitshares-pricefeed .
```

### Alternative manual installation on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or similar.

Install globally:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Zapata/bitshares-pricefeed.git
cd bitshares-pricefeed
python setup.py install
```

Or in a dedicated virtualenv environment:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Zapata/bitshares-pricefeed.git
cd bitshares-pricefeed
pip install virtualenv 
virtualenv -p python3 wrappers_env/ 
source wrappers_env/bin/activate
python setup.py install
```

### Create the configuration file:

You can generate a sample configuration file using:

```
bitshares-pricefeed create
```
Or copy one from the `examples` directory:

File | Description
 --- | --- 
[default](examples/default.yaml) | Default configuration generated by `create` command. Use to publish all the main Bitshares assets.
[bsip42](examples/bsip42.yaml) |  Sample configuration to publish a 'target price' compliant with [BSIP42](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0042.md). See [below](#target-price-mode-(BSIP42)) for more information.
[hero](example/hero.yaml) | [HERO](https://www.sovereignhero.com/) asset publication configuration.
[hertz](example/hertz.yaml) | [HERTZ](https://sites.google.com/view/hertz-aba/) asset publication configuration.
[XCD](example/xcd.yaml) | [XCD](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=25496.0) asset publication configuration.
[stocks](example/stocks.yaml) | Sample configuration to publish Bitshares [NASDAQ stocks trackers](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=26068.0).
[composite](examples/composite.yaml) | Showcase the Composite source feature (see [below](#composite))


Add a feed producer name to the `config.yml` file just created:

```
vim config.yml
# The producer name(s)
producer: your_witness_name
```
### Manual publication

IF you use docker image you can run:

```
docker run -v /path/to/config.yml:/config/config.yml bitshares-pricefeed update --active-key=XXXXXXX
```

If you installed bitshares-pricefeed locally use:
```
bitshares-pricefeed update --active-key=XXXXXXX
```

See [help](#help) for the full description of the command.

Above solution will pass active key credentials on the command line, if you want to reuse a pybitshares wallet see instruction in [Use pybitshares encrypted wallet](#use-pybitshares-encrypted-wallet).

### Schedule publication

Using cron:

```
$ crontab -e
ACTIVE_KEY="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

0,15,30,45 * * * * docker run -v /path/to/config.yaml:/config/config.yaml bitshares-pricefeed update --skip-critical --active-key=$ACTIVE_KEY
```

### Special sources:

#### Manual

A manual source is available to inject some manually set / constand data to the source feed.
This could be usefull for:
  -  testing to avoid connection to a third party datasource.
  -  inject a static rate like BitUSD/USD 

Example:
```
exchanges:
  manual:
    klass: Manual
    feed:
      USD:
        BTS:
          price: 42
          volume: 1
```

#### Composite

A composite source could be used to group multiple sources together in order to aggregate them using a specific fomula.

Aggregation types formulas could be:
  - `min`: select the minimum value for each pairs
  - `max`: select the maximum value for each pairs
  - `mean`: compute the mean price of all the pairs and sum the volume.
  - `weighted_mean`: compute the volume weighted mean price of all the pairs and sum the volume.
  - `median`: compute the median price of all the pairs and sum the volume.
  - `first_valid`: select the first pairs where the source match an ordered list of sources.

The main use cases is if you want to retrieve a pair like BTC/USD from multiples sources (worldcoinindex, bitcoinaverage, coinmarketcap), but you want to use only one of the value in all your computations. The same apply for FIAT exchange rates from (fixer, currencylayer, openexchangerate, ...).

See [example configuration](examples/composite.yaml).

#### Algorithm Based Assets

Some assets use a computed formula as price like HERO or HERTZ. 
Those are implemented with a source class that return the computed value, usually with USD as quote.

## Target price mode (BSIP42)

In order to better maintain the peg of Smartcoins, it might be necessary to apply a negative feedback to the computed price. The published price is no more the market price but a target price. See [BSIP42](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0042.md) for more information.

This could be enabled setting the `target_price_algorithm` option on an asset publication:

```
assets:
    CNY:
        target_price_algorithm: 'adjusted_feed_price'
        target_price_adjustment_scale: 1.2
```

The algorithm used and available are under constant development by Bitshares witnesses, so please look at [examples/bsip42.yaml](examples/bsip42.yaml) for the latest documentation on the possible algorithms and their parameters.

## Use of encrypted wallet

Initialize wallet and enter credentials:

```
$ bitshares-pricefeed addkey
```

You will need to enter your cli wallet encryption passphrase. If you
don't have a pybitshares wallet, yet, one will be created:

```
Wallet Encryption Passphrase:
Repeat for confirmation:
```

You will need to enter your Private Key (Active key) here. Hit enter the second time it asks you.

```
Private Key (wif) [Enter to quit]:
```

Then you can run the feed update without any argument, it will prompt for the Wallet Encryption Passphrase.

```
$ bitshares-pricefeed update
Current Wallet Passphrase:
```

If you don't want to type the Wallet Encryption Passphrase each time, use `UNLOCK` environment variable.

Example in cron:

```
$ crontab -e

SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/home/ubuntu/bin:/home/ubuntu/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
UNLOCK="PASSWD"

0,15,30,45 * * * * bitshares-pricefeed --configfile /home/ubuntu/config.yml --skip-critical --no-confirm-warning update >> /var/log/bitshares-pricefeed.log 2>&1
```

Or with Docker image:

```
docker run -v /path/to/config:/config -v /path/to/wallet:/root/.local/share/bitshares -e UNLOCK=PASS bitshares-pricefeed
```


## Development

To run tests you need get API keys for the providers, and register them as environment variables:

```
export QUANDL_APIKEY=
export OPENEXCHANGERATE_APIKEY=
export FIXER_APIKEY=
export CURRENCYLAYER_APIKEY=
export ALPHAVANTAGE_APIKEY=
export WORLDCOININDEX_APIKEY= 
export MAGICWALLET_APIKEY=
export COINMARKETCAP_APIKEY=
```

To run all tests use:  `pytest`.

To run a specific test: `pytest -k bitcoinvenezuela`.
